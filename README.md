# Liferay OpenAI Content Creation Wizard 

With this application, creating content within Liferay is a breeze!

Consider this scenario: You can create 15 products across 5 categories in just 35 seconds with a single prompt from you. The magic happens with integrating OpenAI's API for content creation and Liferay's APIs for seamless storage based on your prompts.

Utilizing this OpenAI Wizard doesn't just speed up content creation, which many of us are already doing with AI. It goes the extra mile by seamlessly loading it into Liferay through Liferay's Extensive Headless APIs. Big kudos to Steven Lu, who helped identify the potential to optimize the time spent on setting up commerce products, categories, and SKUs through Liferay's Headless APIs.

## Authentication

You have two options of authentication using Liferay Portal

1. Basic
2. OAuth2

The **Basic** authentication is ideal for localhost, dev, staging environments and the authentication method is using **email** and **password**, you must have sufficient permissions to consume the APIs used on the target asset.

**OAuth2** is recommended for production environments, especially if you are using Liferay SaaS, as basic authentication is disabled by default.

You will need to enable the following scopes to use the **openai-demo-wizard**:

- Liferay.Headless.Admin.Taxonomy.everything
- Liferay.Headless.Admin.User.everything
- Liferay.Headless.Admin.Workflow.everything
- Liferay.Headless.Commerce.Admin.Account.everything
- Liferay.Headless.Commerce.Admin.Catalog.everything
- Liferay.Headless.Delivery.everything
- Liferay.Headless.Site.everything
